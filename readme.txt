== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you are logged into WordPress you will not see the coming soon page. You will see your normal website. This is so you can work on it while visitors see the coming soon page. Try using another browser or going **incognito** to view the coming soon page.

If you are logged out of WordPress and still see your normal website then either your browser is caching the page or you having a caching plugin that is serving a cached version of the page. Please disable this until after you have setup the coming soon plugin.
